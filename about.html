      <p>I have always been passionate about art and design. I completed my undergraduate degree in Architecture at the University of Toronto. After graduating, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I wasn't sure if I wanted to pursue the standard trajectory of architecture. I saw friends going to graduate school or diving into the workforce- but I still felt unsure. There lay interest, but not a passion. History is what always attracted me. It became more evident after writing my senior thesis. I knew that purpose and intent were what would always draw me in.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Over time, I heard of friends and past classmates pursuing UX/UI Design. I wanted to learn more about the industry. When I researched the field, I felt more validated by my interest in research and design. I enrolled in a UX/UI program and the rest is history. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Where I stand now, the same principles are meaningful to me. Design should be compelling and filled with meaning- it's what I strive to do. Colour is a vital aspect of my storytelling. If I cannot find the words to communicate, the playful and visual elements will.</p>
